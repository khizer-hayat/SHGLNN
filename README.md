## Self-supervised Heterogeneous Hypergraph Learning with Context-aware Pooling for Graph-level Classification

## Overview
- **kMatrix.py:** K matrix generation for k-hop neighborhood for intra-graph hyperedges.
- **sMatrix.py:** S matrix generation for inter-graph hyperedges.
- **hyperGen.py:** Hypergraph generation using K and S matrices.
- **layers.py:** Includes the nodeConv, hyperConv, and pooling layers of the model.
- **train.py:** Basic model training.
